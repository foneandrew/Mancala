Mancala
=======

small mancala game project

Just a small personal project to play around with some of the Java I have learnt at Victoria.
Also wanted to explore GUI's a bit which is something I havent really done.

The game is a replica of Mancala (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala).
It features rules like the extra turns, capturing, and automatically finishing the game one one players side has no
pieces left.

At the moment it uses a pretty basic text based display of the board with rudimentary controls to play it.

In the future I hope to add (in no particular order):
. some proper graphics
. proper controls and input methods
. display info about the game in progress (eg player 1 captured 6 pieces)
. some form of computer player (either dumb or smart)
. leaderboard/high scores or some other method of measuring sucess in the game
. maybe some sort of testing suite??
. (hopefully) see if I can port it over to android
